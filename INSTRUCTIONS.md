# Assembler Programming Project

See the
[Assembler PP assignment](www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs230/Projects/AssemblerProj.html)
for the instructions for this assignment, coding tips, links to helpful
documents, and submission requirements.

The Assembler project builds upon the LabelTable functions you have already
written.  It also uses the other header files and functions that were
provided to you for that project or that you copied from the DisUtil
project, such as `same.h`, `printFuncs.h`, `processArguments` (`.c` and
`.h`), `printDebug.c`, and `printError.c`, etc.

Thus, the first thing to do for this project is to copy contents of your
LabelTable project into this repository, add and commit them in git, and
push that to this repository as a starting point.  (Make sure to first fix
any errors or make other changes that were suggested in the grading
feedback to LabelTable.)

Once you start working on the Assembler project itself, note that the
Makefile provided to you for the LabelTable project included rules for
compiling the Assembler also.  You will want to change the definition of
the `all` target to include both testLabelTable and assembler (as suggested
in the Makefile comments).

Following agile development principles, repeatedly Edit, Test, and Add/Commit
until the program is done. You can `git push` to Kit as often as you want.
(See the [Working with Git Repositories in
Kit](http://www.cs.kzoo.edu/CSShared/HelpFiles/Kit/RepositoryAssignments.md)
document for more information about writing a program within a Git
repository.)

Don't forget to provide a README.md file with external documentation about
your program, as described in the 
[Assembler PP assignment](www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs230/Projects/AssemblerProj.html).

When you are ready to submit your work, click on the "Turn In"
button. (You should still be able to push further changes to Kit
after turning an assignment in if you need to.)
